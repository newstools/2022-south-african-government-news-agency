Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Chairperson, Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba, has called on law enforcement agencies to act with speed on available evidence to ensure the arrest and successful prosecution of Namhla Mtwa’s killer. Ncube-Ndaba noted that the availability of evidence, which is trending on social media platforms, could lead to the arrest and successful prosecution of the perpetrator who killed Mtwa. Mtwa, who worked at OR Tambo District Municipality’s Budget and Treasury Office, was recently gunned down on her driveway in Mthatha. According to the media reports, a hitman allegedly shot her several times, as she arrived home from work. Ncube-Ndaba called on law enforcement agencies to act with speed on the available evidence to ensure that the perpetrator of this heinous and gruesome killing of Mtwa faces the might of the law. Ncube-Ndaba also appealed to the people of OR Tambo and whoever has any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator to come forward. “We thank those South Africans who have provided the evidence which is on social platforms and which has enough potential to lead to the arrest and prosecution. We are also calling on the people of OR Tambo District and Mthatha to continue with their moral support to the family as the family is still mourning the death of their daughter,” Ncube-Ndaba said. – SAnews.gov.za
