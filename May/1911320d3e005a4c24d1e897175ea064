The discussions during the Africa Communications Week for communication professionals and thought leaders will be looking at impacting the current narratives in Africa, accelerating communications through innovation, Africa Free Trade Area agreement communications and effective media platforms. The various themes to be discussed - highlighting the acceleration of Africa Communications through new mediums and innovation - will provide opportunities to examine how the communication profession can position itself and demonstrate its relevance as a fundamental management discipline that contributes significantly to Africa’s socio-economic rise. – SAnews.gov.za
