The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) will next week kick-off public engagements on Unconventional Gas Regulations in the Northern Cape. The published Unconventional Gas Regulations, which were developed in line with Section 38 of the National Water Act of 1998, prescribe requirements and procedures when using water for unconventional gas activities.
