Eskom has downgraded daytime load shedding from Stage 4 to Stage 3 for the rest of this week. This as the power utility continues attempts to stabilise generation capacity, following at least two weeks of multiple breakdowns and an industrial strike at power stations. “Stage 3 load shedding – previously communicated Stage 4 – will be implemented at 5am to 4pm on Wednesday and Thursday. Between 4pm and [midnight] on both days, load shedding will be implemented at Stage 4. “Eskom anticipates lower stages of load shedding to be implemented through the weekend as some units return to service. Should anything change in the intervening period, Eskom will communicate and implement any changes as may be necessary,” the power utility said in a statement. The electricity supplier added that some 3 934MW of generation capacity is currently out on planned maintenance with another 14 867MW of capacity unavailable due to breakdowns. “As the generation capacity shortages persist over the next few weeks, load shedding will continue to be implemented at various stages. Eskom cautions the public that it will still take a few weeks for the power generation system to recover. “Eskom would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly especially during these uncertain times on the power system,” Eskom said. – SAnews.gov.za
