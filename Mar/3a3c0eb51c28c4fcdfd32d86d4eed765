NatJOINTS comprises government departments, including various disciplines within the South African Police Service, the National Defence Force, Intelligence Coordinating Committee, Johannesburg Metro Police, and Gauteng Traffic Police among other law enforcement agencies Netshiunda said residents of Sandton and surrounding suburbs are advised that there will be limited access in areas around the Sandton Convention Centre between Wednesday evening and Thursday night. “Motorists are advised to use alternative routes as there would be temporary road closures affecting the following streets: West Street, Maude Street, 5th Street and Alice Lane. “Only people with valid accreditation will be allowed to enter the restricted areas in and around the conference venue.
