Due to further failures of generation units, power utility Eskom has escalated load shedding from Stage 2 to Stage 4 on Thursday. The power utility had implemented Stage 2 load shedding on Monday after seven units lost generating capacity over the weekend. Currently, unplanned breakdowns at power stations amount to some 15 439 MW of lost power with at least 5505MW of planned outages underway. In a statement, Eskom said at least four units ran into challenges on Tuesday evening – necessitating the need to escalate the severity of load shedding. “Overnight a unit each at Kendal, Duvha, Camden and Kusile power stations tripped. Since then, we have returned four units to service. However, these units still need to ramp up to full output, which necessitates a high usage of emergency generation reserves today. This being the fourth day of extremely high diesel usage, the emergency reserves are being depleted faster than can be replenished,” the electricity supplier said. Stage 4 load shedding will continue until 5am on Friday morning and will be followed by Stage 2 load shedding until Monday morning. “Stage 4 load shedding will…give us the space required to replenish the emergency reserves and continue to manage the system safely. Eskom would like to apologise for the implementation of load shedding, and will continuously review the situation and act appropriately as circumstances change. “Eskom appeals to all South Africans to help us limit the impact of load shedding by reducing the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items,” the power utility said. The power producer is expected to brief the media on developments at power stations today. – SAnews.gov.za
