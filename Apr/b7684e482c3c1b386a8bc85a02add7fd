Voter registration will be held this weekend for two municipal ward by-elections, scheduled to take place on Wednesday, 15 June 2022. The by-elections will be held in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) on Wednesday said voting stations will be open on Saturday and Sunday from 08h00 to 17h00 to allow all eligible voters to register, and for current voters to check their registration details and to provide/update address details where necessary. Voters are advised to take their identity documents (ID) with them - either a green barcoded ID book, a smartcard ID or a valid Temporary ID Certificate. They will also need to complete their physical home address on registration or provide sufficient particularities of their place of residence. Documented proof of address (e.g. a municipal account) is not required. Voters may also check and update their details at their local IEC office weekdays during office hours.
