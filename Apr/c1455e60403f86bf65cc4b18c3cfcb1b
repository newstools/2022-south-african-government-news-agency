Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) Minister, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, has urged communities in flood-affected areas to exercise caution, as government counts the cost of the recent torrential rains in KwaZulu-Natal. Inclement weather has over the weekend and Monday left a trail of destruction, damaging property and displacing families. Over 40 people are said to have lost their lives. In a statement, CoGTA warned the public to be watchful and cautious, as “water moves quickly downstream", and that flooding can occur even when there is no rain. The South African Weather Service has issued a warning for more rains still expected in many parts of the country. “When flash flood warnings are issued, residents in flood-prone areas or those who are at risk of flooding are advised to move to higher ground. “At this stage, Provincial and Local Disaster Management teams across the country are on alert and assisting communities affected by the floods. The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) is in contact with provincial and local disaster management centres on the ground to monitor the situation and provide support,” the weather service said. Dlamini Zuma expresses her deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives as a result of the recent rains. Safety tips People living in low-lying areas must take special care during storms, as sudden floods might affect them. They should monitor the rising water levels and evacuate the areas to a safer place or higher spot when the water level rises.  Where possible, communities are encouraged to try to avoid contact with any floodwaters. The water may be contaminated with raw sewage, oil or other dangerous substances, and may also be charged with electricity from fallen powerlines. – SAnews.gov.za
