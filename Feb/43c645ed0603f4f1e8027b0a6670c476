State power utility Eskom will implement Stage 2 load shedding from 11am today until 5am on Monday morning. Eskom said this was due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns at two generating units. The breakdowns amount to at least 14 994 MW of energy. “Since the weekend Eskom has utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted and need to be replenished. Eskom will need this period of load shedding to replenish the emergency generation reserves. “A unit each and Kusile and Kendal power stations tripped. Delays in returning units at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Lethabo and Grootvlei have also contributed to the current supply constraints,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. The power utility said it expects at least three generating units back in service by Wednesday afternoon. “Eskom appeals to all South Africans to help limit the impact of load shedding by reducing the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items. “We will communicate promptly should there be any significant changes to the power system.” -SAnews.gov.za
