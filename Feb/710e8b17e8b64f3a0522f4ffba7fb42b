The Department of Water and Sanitation has urged various municipalities to conduct the necessary drinking water analysis in their respective areas amid reports of typhoid cases. The department said it has been inundated with enquiries regarding the quality of drinking water in light of the increasing media reports of typhoid cases and gastro-related complaints in some parts of the country. “Due to the widespread messages going around on various social media platforms, it is advised that this approach is taken whether gastro-related cases have been reported or not. “We urge municipalities to communicate regularly with the communities that they serve to prevent misinformation being peddled on social media,” said department spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau. Ratau said the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has also set out some guidelines to be followed to ensure community safety. In case of doubt, the following preventative measures for the public include:  Recent cases not linked to tap water Meanwhile, Rand Water has noted that the recent typhoid cases reported in the news have not been linked to tap water. Rand Water spokesperson, Justice Mohale, assured residents that Rand Water’s drinking water treatment processes are effective in inactivating harmful bacteria.
