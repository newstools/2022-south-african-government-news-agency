Cabinet has welcomed the 2022 National Budget tabled by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, saying it demonstrates government’s commitment to fiscal discipline. “The budget demonstrates government’s commitment to fiscal discipline and consistent economic management, and its cherished objective of funding critical priorities that provide socio-economic support to vulnerable South Africans,” Cabient said on a statement on Thursday. The budget, the executive said, put some flesh to the commitments made by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his 2022 State of the Nation Address (SONA), delivered on 10 February. Godongwana tabled the budget in the Good Hope Chamber, Parliament, on Wednesday. Cabinet said the far-reaching interventions announced in the budget are geared towards creating a conducive environment for inclusive growth and sustainable development. Meanwhile, Cluster Ministers will be holding post-SONA media briefings to elaborate on government’s Programme of Action for the year ahead and beyond, as outlined by President Ramaphosa in SONA. “These media briefings highlight government’s commitment to implement the priorities aimed at improving the lives of the people by, among other things, creating favourable conditions to create much-needed jobs,” Cabinet said. Later this afternoon, the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) will host a media briefing of the Social Protection, Community and Human Development Cluster. Ministries in this cluster include Transport, Higher Education and Training, Health, Basic Education, Labour and Social Development, among others. – SAnews.gov.za
