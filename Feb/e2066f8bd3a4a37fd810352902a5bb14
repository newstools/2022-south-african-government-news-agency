The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence (JSCI) will next week interview the 10 shortlisted candidates for the position of the Inspector-General of Intelligence. In a statement, the Committee said the interviews would be conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday. In December, JSCI chairperson Jerome Maake announced that two of the shortlisted candidates, Adv Mahlodi Sam Muofhe and Dr Nakampe Michael Masiapato, had officially withdrawn from the process for various reasons.

The approved candidate is then appointed by the President of the Republic as the Inspector-General of Intelligence in terms of section 7(1) of the Intelligence Services Oversight Act 40 of 1994 (the Act).
