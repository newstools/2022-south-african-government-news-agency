With many households and businesses still under financial pressure, National Treasury will not be increasing taxes to keep money in the taxpayer’s pocket. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said this when he tabled his maiden budget speech before a sitting of Parliament on Wednesday. “Households and businesses are still under financial pressure and are coping with higher obligations, the effects of COVID-19 and increased fuel prices. “Now is not the time to increase taxes and put the recovery at risk. Accordingly, we have decided to keep money in the pockets of South Africans,” he said. The proposal in the budget includes R5.2 billion in tax relief to help support economic recovery, provide some respite from fuel tax increases, and boost incentives for youth employment. National Treasury tax proposals for 2022/23 are as follows: “In 2021, the inland petrol price breached R20 per litre. The higher prices have put pressure on the cost of transport, food and other goods and services. “To provide some relief to households, no increases will be made to the general fuel levy on petrol and diesel for 2022/23. This will provide tax relief of R3.5 billion to South Africans.” Godongwana said there will also be no increase in the Road Accident Fund levy. “[Mineral Resources and Energy] Minister [Gwede] Mantashe and I have agreed that a review of all aspects of the fuel price is needed. Our teams have already begun to engage on this critical work.” –SAnews.gov.za
